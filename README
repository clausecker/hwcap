Print or query the supported CPU features.

   hwcap [-s source] [-f format] [feature...]

Print the CPU features / hardware capabilities.  If any features
are given as arguments, check if all features are supported.
Return a zero exit status if all are supported, otherwise return
a nonzero exit status.

 -s source

    Query CPU features from given source.  The default is
    platform-dependent.

    hwcap  Query CPU features using elf_aux_info(3) from the
           AT_HWCAP and AT_HWCAP2 vector (riscv, arm)

    cpuid  Query CPU features by asking the CPU directly (x86, arm)

    isa    Query CPU features by parsing the ISA string (riscv)

    args   Print the features given as command line arguments

 -f format

    Print CPU features in the given format.

    hwcap  Print capabilities as given by elf_aux_info(3).  Default if not
           checking for any features.

    none   Do not produce any output (default if checking for features)

    archlevel
           Print the architecture level (x86)

    isa    Print the ISA string (riscv)

    cflags Print cc(3) compiler flags that enable the detected features

    verbose
           Print feature flags with description

RETURN VALUE

    0      All requested features were detected, no errors.

    1      Some of the requested features were not detected

    >=64   An error occured, see sysexits(3)
